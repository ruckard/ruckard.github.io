<h2><mark>About CopyTrader - First steps</mark></h2>
In the <b>CopyTrader - First steps</b> tool you can learn step by step how to become a CopyTrader in the Zignaly platform. This is more a tutorial or a course so that you learn and understand each of the steps you do here. Once you grasp what being a CopyTrader is and how its services are managed you can go back to the <a href="../classic/">Zignaly Signal Wizard</a> and work on the TradingView side if you want to.


<h2><mark>What a Copy-Trader service is</mark></h2>
<li><b>Copy-Trader</b> service. You are a trader whom others would copy, not a final user whom would copy other traders trades. In this mode the users do not need to transfer any funds from their exchanges in order for you to manage it. Or you can make it private for testing your own strategies.</li>
<br/>
<b>If you are unsure if you want to offer a Copy-Trader service or not please learn about SignalProvider and ProfitSharing services.</b>

<a name="steps">
<h2><mark>Steps</mark></h2>

Please check on the first step below to launch the wizard:

<ul>
<li><a href="10_zignaly_user_signup.html">Sign-up as a Zignaly platform user.</a></li>
<li>Create a Copy-Trade service in Zignaly.</li>
<li>Create an exchange account in Zignaly with the same Exchange (e.g. Binance) and Exchange type (e.g. futures) that you will be offering as a provider.</li>
<li>Make sure that there are funds (As per 2021: <b>15 USDT should be a minimum</b> to be safe) in your recently linked exchange account in Zignaly (Usually Binance).</li>
<li>Make sure you have selected your new created exchange account (just in case you have several of them)</li>
<li><b>You have to follow your own service in Zignaly and allocate to it some of your funds.</b></li>
<li><b>Make your order amount meet the minimal amount required by the Exchange (E.g. Minimum: 0.001 BTC or USDT equivalent for Bitcoin).</b>
If you allocate 100 USDT and you open a Bitcoin position based on 20% of your allocation it will try open a position with 20 USDT. This is not going to work because with current price (1 BTC = 56,955.08 USDT) that means 0.00035136 BTC and that it's way less than the current Binance minimum: 0.001 BTC = 56.91 USDT. You can try to avoid this problem by using LTC instead, using futures and leverage (if you know what you are doing) or increasing your allocated funds.</li>
<li>I highly encourage you to test the Trading Terminal (making sure you choose your own service and not 'Manual Trading') to feel how Zignaly works. You will learn how it replicates into Binance (In CopyTrading/SignalProvider).</li>
<li>Even if you are going to create a 'Profit Sharing' service I highly encourage you to create a private Copy Trading service initially as a personal test. That way you can check how Zignaly interacts with Binance (How orders are created, closed and so on). And, again, use the Trading Terminal.</li>
</ul>
